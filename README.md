# EventX
A java application where users can buy tickets of the events they would like to be a part of. This was our second year's Object oriented programming's project. 

We used Java, GUI and MySQL in this project. the repository contains the UML diagram as well.

The Application: 
- there are 3 users (guest, student and lecturer/instructor).
- the first thing to do is login or signup for new users (and they will recieve an email to their gmail account to welcome them to the EventX App).
- after login, they will see a page of all the events and their discription. 
- user can buy tickets for the event of their choice.

Note: 
- there are valid constraints for bank card informations on the buy ticket GUI page.
- we used MySQL for the user's email and password, as well as the list of events.
